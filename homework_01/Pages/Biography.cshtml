    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <h3>Childhood</h3>

    <p>
        Taras Shevchenko was born on March 9, 1814, in the village of Moryntsi, in Ukraine. He was born into a family of serfs, a status that significantly shaped his early life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taras did not have a surname in the modern sense; "Shevchenko" indicates his ancestry, as it was derived from the profession
        of his ancestors, who were cobblers (Ukrainian: "Shevchenko" means "shoemaker's son").

        On the 9th of March, 1814, my son Taras was born, son of Hryhoriy Ivanovych Shevchenko and Kateryna Yakymivna Boiko. He was
        baptized by Father Hryhoriy Dmytriv.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        He was the third child in the family, and his early years were marked by poverty and hardship. His father was literate,
        and despite their status, he tried to provide his children with some basic education. Taras learned to read at a young age,
        which would later be pivotal in his development as a poet and artist.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Taras was nine, his mother died, and his father remarried soon after. Unfortunately, the stepmother was cruel, and Taras
        suffered from her harsh treatment. His father passed away two years later, leaving Taras orphaned at the age of eleven.

    <p>
        Taras became a servant in the household of a landowner, Pavlo Engelhardt. Despite the difficult circumstances, his talent
        for drawing became evident, and Engelhardt later took him to Vilnius and Saint Petersburg, where Taras's talent was noticed
        by several influential artists.

    <h3>Artistic and Literary Career</h3>

    <p>
        In 1838, with the help of his friends and fellow artists, including the Russian painter Karl Bryullov, Taras Shevchenko was
        bought out of serfdom. The money for his freedom was raised by selling a portrait of the poet Vasily Zhukovsky painted by
        Bryullov.
    </p>

    <p>
        After gaining his freedom, Shevchenko enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, where he studied under
        Bryullov. He quickly gained recognition as a talented artist, particularly in the field of portrait painting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Around this time, he also began writing poetry. In 1840, his first collection of poetry, "Kobzar," was published. The
        collection's nationalistic themes and its use of the Ukrainian language made it immensely popular among Ukrainians, but
        it also attracted the attention of the authorities, who viewed it as subversive.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1847, Shevchenko was arrested by the Russian authorities for his involvement in the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius,
        a secret political society that advocated for the abolition of serfdom and the autonomy of Ukraine. He was sentenced to
        military service in the Russian army in the remote regions of Kazakhstan and was prohibited from writing or painting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite the harsh conditions, Shevchenko continued to write in secret, often composing his works in his head and later
        committing them to paper when he could. His later works reflect his deepening despair and his longing for freedom, both
        for himself and for his homeland.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1857, after ten years of exile, Shevchenko was finally released. He returned to Saint Petersburg, where he continued to
        write and paint, though his health had been severely compromised by the years of harsh treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shevchenko's later years were marked by a growing recognition of his work. In 1860, he was elected a member of the Imperial
        Academy of Arts, and his poetry became increasingly influential in the growing Ukrainian national movement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Taras Shevchenko died on March 10, 1861, the day after his 47th birthday. He was initially buried in Saint Petersburg, but
        in accordance with his wishes, his remains were later transferred to Ukraine, where he was reburied on Chernecha Hill
        near the Dnipro River, a place that he loved deeply.
